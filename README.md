# Photos-exporter

This applescript is exporting photos from Apple Photos.app

- The scrips will export all the pictures in albums and folders preserving the hierarchy of the app: a new directory will be created for each folder in Photos and inside new directories for each album.

- It exports "The current versions" (i.e. not the originals)

One possible use for this script would be to run a backup of all the photos to have them outside the proprietary library.

## Run

Create a folder where the photos will be stored and change the location path (destination_folder) in the script. 


# WARNING:

1. The program do not have any "settings" yet

2. The scrips will assume that you have albums within folders. Will not work if you have folders inside other folders.
